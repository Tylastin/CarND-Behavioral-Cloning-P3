## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/432/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode

* writeup_report.md or writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable

The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed
My model architercture is based on the behavioral cloning CNN found here: https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/.

My model consists of a convolution neural network with 3 5x5 convolutions, 2 3x3 convolutions, a flatten layer, and 3 fully connected layers.
The following image illustrates the model architecture.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  

Every convolution layer includes RELU activation to introduce nonlinearity, and the data is normalized in the model using a Keras lambda layer. The images are also cropped using a Cropping 2D layer. This is done to eliminete irrelevant backround data such as trees and sky pixels.



#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model


The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting. Furhtermore only 1 epoch was used to reduce the chance of overfitting. The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually. The adam optimizer was able to produce minimal validation error on the first epoch. 

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving and  smooth turning. For both of these cases images from all three cameras were used (with an angle correction factor applied in preprocessing) to enable the model to learn to recover after veering off the center. 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to start with an architecture that has proven effective for a similar task and modify and tune as needed to increase performance. 

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the Nvidia behavioral cloning CNN found here: https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/. This model seemed like a great starting point because the goal of the model described in the Nvidia paper is similar to the goal of this project.

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that the model had a low mean squared error on both the traning and validation set after minimal training. This was expected because this model has proven effective for similar tasks in the past.

Major changes to the model architecture proved unecesssary so none were made.

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I augmented the training data by adding: A mirror image with a mirrored steering value(negative),
a eft camera image with a correction factor (+0.2),
, and a right camera image with a correction factor (-0.2)

At the end of the process, the vehicle was able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture was based on the Nvidia architecture presented earlier in this writeup. 
The model consists of a convolution neural network with 3 5x5 convolutions, 2 3x3 convolutions, a flatten layer, and 3 fully connected layers.
The following table, produced by Model.summary(), illustrates the model architecture.

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

The sample training data provided proved sufficient to accomplish the task. 

To capture good driving behavior, the data included mostly center-lane driving. Smooth turning data was also recorded. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

The data also included left and right camera images with corrected steering values. Using the images from the left and right cameras enabled the vehicle to learn to recover smoothly after falling off the center line. These images show the left, center, and right camera images.

To augment the data set, I also flipped the center camera images and made the corresponding angles negative in order to counteract the data bias that exists because driving clockwise around the track involves only left turns. For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

The sample training data had 8036 data points. After augmentation, the amount of training data increased to 32144. I then preprocessed this data by normalizing, mean centering, and cropping the pixel data.


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. I implemented generators to efficiently load and preprocess the data.

I trained the model using the preprocessed training data. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 1 as evidenced by the validation loss being the lowest afer the first epoch. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.
